		 * Step 1: Define the variables Use A, P, r, n, t You must decide what datatypes
		 * to make each according to their purpose: 
		 * A - Accrued Amount; this is the amount you're solving for 
		 * P - Principle; set this to the current balance. 
		 * r - rate of interest; set this to 0.15 
		 * n - number of times the amount is compounded; set this to 12 
		 * t - number of years; set this to 1 to represent 1 year
		 * 
		 * Step 2: Calculate the Accrued Amount Use the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)nt
		 * 
		 * Step 3: Print the result to the console
